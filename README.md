# family-map-client

Family Map is an application that provides a geographical view of your family history. One of the most exciting aspects of researching family history is discovering your origins. Family Map provides a detailed view of where you came from. It does so by displaying information about important events in your ancestorsâ€™ lives (birth, marriage, death, etc.), and plotting their locations on a Google map.

This app is built using client-server architecture; this is the client. The client was created in Android Studio and implements a Google Maps API to provide a geographical view of the user's family history.
